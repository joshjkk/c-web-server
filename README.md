# Web Server

A barebones web server in C.

## Why?

I love C.

## Build from source

The build is Makefile-based, so make sure you have GNU Make and GCC installed on your system, then run the following command:

``` bash
make
```

## Run from source

Run the following command to start the server, may take a few minutes in between uses:

``` bash
sudo ./webserver.out
```

You will receive the following info in the terminal:

``` bash
==== WAITING FOR CONNECTION TO [address] ====
```

In order to see the web server, open your favourite browser and go to ```[address]```.

The server will then stop and may take a minute or two to use again.
